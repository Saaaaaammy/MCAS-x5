\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project is to design a control system for the pitch of an aircraft. The control system diagram to get us started is shown in figure 1.\\\\
The input of the system is given by \(\delta\), the elevator deflection angle. Figure 1 also shows the angle of attack, \(\alpha\), the pitch angle \(\theta\) and the pitch rate \(r\).\\\\
Our Task is to do what boeing couldn't and design an MCAS system that is BIBO stable to keep the aircraft at a safe pitch and make sure that 737 max passengers only have to worry about doors falling off and not the aircraft nosediving.\\\\
