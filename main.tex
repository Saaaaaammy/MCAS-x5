\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project is to design a control system for the pitch of an aircraft. The control system diagram to get us started is shown in figure 1.\\\\
The input of the system is given by \(\delta\), the elevator deflection angle. Figure 1 also shows the angle of attack, \(\alpha\), the pitch angle \(\theta\) and the pitch rate \(r\).\\\\
Our Task is to do what boeing couldn't and design an MCAS system that is BIBO stable to keep the aircraft at a safe pitch and make sure that 737 max passengers only have to worry about doors falling off and not the aircraft nosediving.\\\\

\section{The System}
The system dynamics are described by the following equations:
\[\dot{\alpha}=-0.31\alpha + 56.7r + 0.231\delta\]
\[\dot{r}=-0.014\alpha - 0.426r +0.0203\delta\]
\[\dot{\theta} = 56.7r\]\\
The sensor has the transfer function:
\[G_m(s) = exp(-0.005s)\]

\section{Analysis - Deriving a Transfer Function}
We start by applying a Laplace transform to each of these equations:
\[\dot{\alpha}=-0.31\alpha + 56.7r + 0.231\delta\Rightarrow SA =-0.31A  + 56.7R + 0.231 \Delta\]
\[\dot{r}=-0.014\alpha - 0.426r +0.0203\delta\Rightarrow SR=-0.014A  - 0.426R +0.0203 \Delta \]
\[\dot{\theta} = 56.7r\Rightarrow S \Theta = 56.7R\]\\
If we then make A the subject of both equations [1.1] and [1.2] we get:  
\[A(S + 0.31) =56.7R + 0.231 \Delta \Rightarrow A = \frac{56.7R +0.231 \Delta}{S + 0.31}\]
\[0.014A = 0.0203\delta - R(S+0.426) \Rightarrow A= \frac{0.0203\delta - R(S+0.426)}{0.014}\]
\[\therefore \frac{56.7R +0.231 \Delta}{S + 0.31} = \frac{0.0203\delta - R(S+0.426)}{0.014}\]
\[0.7938R +0.003234\Delta=(S+0.31)[0.0203\Delta - R(0.426+S)]\]
\[RHS = (S + 0.31)[0.0203\Delta - R(0.426 +S)]\]
\[=(S+0.31)[0.0203\Delta - 0.426R - RS]\]
\[=0.0203\Delta S -0.426 RS - RS^2 +0.006293\Delta - 0.13206R -0.31RS\]
\[=0.0203 \Delta S -0.736RS - RS^2 + 0.006293\Delta - 0.13206R\]
\[0.7938R + 0.736 RS + 0.13206R +RS^2 = 0.0203\Delta S +0.006293\Delta -  0.003234\Delta\]
\[0.92586R + 0.736 RS + RS^2 = 0.0203 \Delta S - 0.003056\Delta\]
\[R(0.92586 +0.736S + S^2) = \Delta (0.0203S - 0.003056)\]

\[\frac{S\Theta}{56.7}(0.92586 + 0.0736S +S^2)=\Delta(0.0203S - 0.003056)\]
\[\frac{56.7(0.0203S - 0.003056)}{S\Theta(0.92586 + 0.7365S+S^2)} = \frac{\Theta}{\Delta}\]
\[\frac{\Theta}{\Delta} = \frac{0.15101S - 0.1732752}{0.92586S + 0.736S^2 + S^3}\]
